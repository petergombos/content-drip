# Day 3: Launch Your Course and Get Your First Subscribers

Your course is written. Today you make it real. This page covers the full launch process — landing page copy, where to find subscribers, and how to think about growth from zero.

## The landing page formula

Your landing page has one job: convince the right person to enter their email. It doesn't need to be long. It needs to be clear.

### The headline
This is your one-sentence course description — the specific transformation you promise. Write it as a benefit, not a description.

| Description (weak) | Benefit (strong) |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| "An email course about cold outreach" | "Write a cold email you'd actually reply to — in 3 lessons" |
| "Learn how to grow on LinkedIn" | "Go from 200 to 2,000 LinkedIn followers in 30 days — one lesson a day" |
| "A course on sourdough baking" | "Bake your first sourdough loaf this weekend — a 5-day email guide" |

### The subheadline
One or two sentences expanding on the headline. Answer: who is this for, and what will they be able to do afterward?

### The lesson list
3–5 bullet points previewing the lessons. This is social proof before anyone subscribes — it shows you've thought through the curriculum and know what you're doing.

- **Day 1:** [Specific lesson title]
- **Day 2:** [Specific lesson title]
- **Day 3:** [Specific lesson title]

### The signup form
Keep it simple: just an email field. Every additional field reduces conversion. ContentDrip's built-in form handles confirmation and delivery schedule selection automatically.

### Credibility (optional)
A one-sentence bio mentioning why you're qualified to teach this. Keep it short and specific. "I've sent 200+ cold emails and booked 40% of them" beats "marketing professional with 10 years experience."

## Finding your first subscribers

### Start with your existing network

Your first 10–50 subscribers should come from people who already know and trust you. Post about the course once on every platform where you have an audience — Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, a personal newsletter. Don't over-explain. Just share the landing page with your one-sentence promise.

"I built a free email course on [topic]. It's 3 emails over 3 days. Here's the link if you're interested."

That's the post. Keep it short. Link in post is fine. Don't bury the lede.

### Find the communities where your audience already is

Identify 3–5 online communities where your specific audience hangs out. This might be:
- Subreddits (r/freelance, r/webdev, r/personalfinance)
- Discord servers in your niche
- Facebook groups
- Slack communities
- LinkedIn groups

Before you post about your course, spend a week adding genuine value: answering questions, sharing insights, being useful. Then, when someone asks a question your course directly answers, mention it: "I actually put together a free email course on exactly this — [link]."

This approach works because it's not promotion, it's relevance.

### Make referral frictionless

Add a line to your final course email: "If this was useful, forward it to someone who'd find it helpful." No pressure, no incentive, just permission. A small percentage of your subscribers will do it, and those referrals tend to be high-quality (they were personally recommended by someone the new subscriber trusts).

## How to think about growth

### Start smaller than you think you should

Your first version of the course is not the final version. It's a draft that you're going to improve based on what you learn from real subscribers. That means:

- You want to launch when you have 3 good emails, not 7 perfect ones
- You want to get feedback from your first 20 subscribers before optimizing for scale
- You want a small test before a big push

### The metrics that matter early

| Metric | What it tells you | Healthy range |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Open rate | Is your subject line working? | 40–60% |
| Click rate (companion page) | Is the content engaging? | 10–25% |
| Completion rate | Is the full course worth finishing? | 40–60% |
| Unsubscribe rate | Is something off? | <5% per email |

If your open rates are low, fix subject lines first. If completion is low, look at email length and lesson clarity. If unsubscribes spike at a specific email, that email has a problem.

### Iterate, don't rebuild

Once your course is live, you have a feedback loop. Pay attention to:
- Which emails get the most replies (topic resonance)
- Which companion pages get the most time spent (deep interest)
- Where people drop off (friction or weak content)

Make one change at a time and see what moves. This is how good courses get built — not in a single burst of inspiration, but through iteration.

## Your launch checklist

- [ ] Welcome email written and proofread
- [ ] Day 1–3 emails written and proofread
- [ ] Companion pages live (auto-generated by ContentDrip)
- [ ] Landing page headline passes the one-sentence test
- [ ] Lesson list in landing page is specific and compelling
- [ ] Signup form tested end-to-end (signed up with your own email)
- [ ] Confirmation email received and looks correct
- [ ] First lesson delivered and renders well in your email client
- [ ] Posted about the course in at least one place today

## You built something real

An email course that delivers itself, on a schedule your subscribers choose, forever. Every time someone signs up, they get the full course experience — no maintenance required from you.

Here's what you built over 3 days:
- **Day 1:** A validated topic and a mapped curriculum
- **Day 2:** Emails with hooks, lessons, and actions that work
- **Day 3:** A live course with a plan for growth

The only thing left to do is ship it.
