# Day 2: Write Emails People Actually Open (and Finish)

Today's email gave you the structure. This page gives you the templates.

## Subject line formulas that work

Your subject line is the most important sentence in your email — it determines whether anything else gets read. Here are the formulas that consistently perform well for courses:

### The day + promise formula
```
Day 1: [Specific outcome]
```
- "Day 1: The subject line formula that gets a 40% open rate"
- "Day 2: Write your landing page headline in 10 minutes"
- "Welcome: You're 4 emails away from your first sale"

### The question formula
```
[Question your subscriber is already asking themselves]
```
- "Are your subject lines hurting your open rates?"
- "What do the best email courses have in common?"
- "Why do most online courses have a 5% completion rate?"

### The number formula
```
[Number] [things] that [outcome]
```
- "3 subject line mistakes killing your open rates"
- "The 5-part email structure that gets replies"
- "1 change that doubled my course completion rate"

**What to avoid:** Clickbait, vague teasers, "RE:" tricks, and anything that overpromises. Course subscribers are choosing to receive your emails — they don't need manipulation, they need clarity.

## Writing the hook

The first two sentences determine whether anyone reads the rest. Here are three hook styles that work:

### The problem hook
Open with the problem your lesson solves. Don't warm up.

> Most welcome emails get a 40% open rate but a 4% click rate. The gap is in the first paragraph — and it's almost always the same mistake.

### The surprising fact hook
Open with something that challenges an assumption.

> The average online course has a 97% abandonment rate. Email courses consistently hit 40–60% completion. The format is the reason.

### The direct statement hook
Just tell them what they're getting. Works especially well for action-heavy lessons.

> Today you're writing your first email. Here's exactly how to structure it.

What doesn't work: "Hey [first name], hope you're having a great week!" They know you don't know how their week is going. Start with value.

## Writing the lesson body

**The single-idea rule:** Each email should teach exactly one thing. If you find yourself writing a second concept, save it for the next email. This is the hardest discipline in email course writing, and it's also why email courses work — subscribers can actually absorb and apply one idea between emails.

**Length:** Aim for 150–300 words for the lesson section. Long enough to be useful, short enough to read in under 3 minutes.

**Structure within the lesson:**
1. State the concept plainly
2. Explain why it matters
3. Show how it works (example, template, or short walkthrough)
4. Connect back to their specific situation

**Tone:** Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend — not like you're publishing an article. Contractions are good. Short paragraphs are good. First person is good.

## Writing the action (CTA)

Every email needs one clear next step. The action should be:

- **Specific:** "Write your one-sentence course description" not "Think about your topic"
- **Small:** Completable in 5–15 minutes
- **Connected:** Directly applies the lesson they just read
- **Visible:** They should be able to see the result when they're done

Good actions:
- "Open a doc and write your welcome email using the template above"
- "Send your course landing page URL to one person and ask if they'd sign up"
- "Set a 20-minute timer and write your Day 1 subject line and hook"

Bad actions:
- "Start thinking about your course"
- "Explore some options"
- "Let me know how it goes!" (this isn't an action)

## Writing the tease

End each email (except the last) with a one-sentence preview of what's coming next. This reduces unsubscribes and builds anticipation.

> Tomorrow: how to write a landing page headline in 10 minutes — even if you hate writing copy.

> Next: the distribution strategy that got the first 200 subscribers on my list.

> Day 3 is the launch. See you tomorrow.

Keep it specific enough to be interesting, vague enough to create curiosity.

## A full worked example

Here's an email from a hypothetical "How to Write Better Cold Emails" course, annotated:

---

**Subject:** Day 2: The cold email structure that gets replies

**[Hook — problem]**
Most cold emails fail in the first sentence. Not because they're too long or too short, but because they start with the wrong thing: the sender.

**[Lesson — concept]**
Here's the rule: the first sentence should be about them. Not you, not your company, not "I came across your profile." Something specific to their world that shows you've actually paid attention.

**[Lesson — how]**
The structure that works:
1. Open with something specific to them (a recent post, a project, a shared context)
2. Make the connection to why you're reaching out (one sentence)
3. Ask for the smallest possible thing (a 15-minute call, not a demo)

**[Action]**
Rewrite the first sentence of your last cold email so it starts with something specific to the recipient. One sentence. That's it.

**[Tease]**
Tomorrow: how to write the follow-up that actually gets a response.

That's 175 words. It delivers the concept, shows how it works, gives a clear action, and sets up the next email. That's the template.

Tomorrow we talk about getting your course in front of people.
