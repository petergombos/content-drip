# Day 1: Pick Your Topic and Map Your Curriculum

The email covered the one-sentence test and the curriculum skeleton. This page goes deeper — including what to do when you're stuck between ideas, and a worked example of a full curriculum plan.

## The one-sentence test: worked examples

Here's the template again:

> "This course helps **[specific person]** do **[specific thing]** in **[timeframe or format]**."

Let's see it in action across different domains:

| Domain | Too broad | Passes the test |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Writing | "How to write better" | "How to write a weekly newsletter in 90 minutes — in 4 emails" |
| Fitness | "Get in shape" | "How to build a consistent 20-minute morning workout habit — in one week" |
| Business | "Start a business" | "How to validate your first product idea before building it — in 3 days" |
| Cooking | "Learn to cook" | "5 pantry meals you can make in 20 minutes — one recipe a day" |
| Tech | "Learn to code" | "Build your first Python script to automate a boring task — in 5 lessons" |

Notice that the right column is useful even without context. You could share any of those sentences with a stranger and they'd immediately know if it's for them.

## How to choose between multiple ideas

If you wrote down 3 ideas yesterday and can't decide, run them through this filter:

**1. Which one do people already ask you about?**
If you've answered the same question more than three times, that's a course. You're already teaching it informally.

**2. Which one has the clearest "before and after"?**
The best courses create a visible transformation. "Before: confused about X. After: able to do Y." The clearer that arc, the easier everything else gets — the landing page, the emails, the subject lines.

**3. Which one could you write tomorrow?**
Don't optimize for "biggest opportunity." Optimize for "can actually launch." A narrow course that ships beats a comprehensive course that doesn't.

## The curriculum skeleton: a deeper look

In the email, we outlined a 4-lesson structure. Here's how to think about each slot:

### Welcome email
**Job:** Get subscribers excited and take one small action.
- Why this topic matters to *them specifically*
- What they'll be able to do after the course
- One tiny first step (5 minutes max)
- Preview of what's coming

Avoid: biography, extensive credentials, long backstory. They signed up. They're already interested. Start with the value.

### Day 1: The foundation
**Job:** Give subscribers the framework everything else builds on.
This is the "mental model" email. Before they can do anything useful, they need to understand *how you think about this topic*. What's the one lens that makes everything else make sense?

### Day 2: The first skill
**Job:** Give them something they can apply today.
This is the most action-oriented email. A technique, a template, a process — something concrete that produces a result they can see.

### Day 3 (if you have it): The advanced move or launch
**Job:** Take them from "I understand it" to "I'm doing it."
This is where you send them off confident. Either an advanced technique that builds on Days 1 and 2, or a specific plan for applying everything they've learned.

### Final email (optional)
**Job:** Celebrate completion and give them a next step.
What should they do now that they've finished? Link to a resource, a community, your newsletter, a paid product — whatever's the most natural next thing.

## Your curriculum planning template

Copy this into a doc and fill it in:

```
Course: [One-sentence description]

Welcome
  Subject:
  Lesson: Why this matters + what's coming
  Action:

Day 1
  Subject:
  Lesson: [The foundational concept]
  Action:

Day 2
  Subject:
  Lesson: [The first skill]
  Action:

Day 3
  Subject:
  Lesson: [The advanced move or launch step]
  Action:
```

Don't write the emails yet. Just the subject lines, the lesson title, and the action. That's your map.

Tomorrow we write the emails.
