# Welcome to How to Write an Email Course

You signed up for an email course about writing email courses. That might sound circular, but it's actually the fastest way to understand why the format works so well: you're going to experience it firsthand while learning how to build it yourself.

## Why email courses outperform every other format

Online education has a completion problem. The average MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) has a completion rate of around 3–15%. Udemy courses average around 10%. But email courses consistently see 40–60% completion rates. Sometimes higher.

The reasons aren't complicated:

**Delivery over destination.** Most online courses require the learner to remember to log in, find their place, and choose to engage. Email courses do the opposite — the lesson shows up in the place where people already spend time and attention. You don't have to compete with "I'll watch this later." You're already there.

**One thing at a time.** A video course can have 47 lectures. An email course has 4 emails. That constraint forces you to be ruthless about what's actually essential — which makes the content better and easier to finish.

**Paced learning works.** Spreading lessons across multiple days means subscribers have time to try things between emails. That application is what turns information into skill.

**No platform dependency.** Email works everywhere, forever. No app to download, no account to create, no subscription to maintain.

## How ContentDrip works

ContentDrip is the open-source platform running this course. Here's how it works:

1. **You write your course** as a series of markdown files — one file per lesson
2. **Subscribers sign up** through a landing page and choose their delivery schedule (daily, every other day, weekly, etc.)
3. **ContentDrip handles the rest** — email confirmation, scheduled delivery, companion pages, unsubscribe links, and progress tracking

The entire system runs on your own infrastructure. No monthly fees per subscriber. No platform lock-in. Your list is yours.

## What you'll have by Day 3

By the end of this course, you'll have:

- A course topic that's specific, validated, and compelling
- A 3–5 lesson curriculum with each lesson doing a clear job
- At least one email written using the structure that gets results
- A plan for launching and growing your subscriber list

## Before tomorrow

Write down 3 things you know well enough to teach someone in 3–5 emails. They don't have to be major expertise — they just need to be things where you're further along than your audience.

Good examples:
- How to set up a home studio for under $500
- The exact process I use to write a weekly newsletter in under 2 hours
- What I learned from 6 months of growing a sourdough starter

The best email courses are narrow and specific. "Everything about marketing" is a book. "How to write a cold email that gets a reply" is an email course.

We'll narrow yours down tomorrow.
