You just signed up for an email course *about* email courses. Which means you already understand the format — and that's actually a great start.

Over the next 3 days, you'll build the foundations of your first email course: a topic that fits, a curriculum that flows, and emails people will actually finish reading.

## What you'll have by Day 3

- A validated course topic (no more "but who would even care about this?")
- A 3–5 email curriculum mapped out, lesson by lesson
- Your first email written and ready to send
- A simple plan for getting your first subscribers

## Why email courses work

Most online courses have a 3–15% completion rate. Email courses routinely hit 40–60%. The reason is simple: the inbox is where people actually pay attention. You're not asking them to log into a platform, find their course, and remember where they left off. You show up for them — on a schedule they chose.

That's what ContentDrip makes possible. You write the course once. It delivers itself, on repeat, to everyone who signs up.

## Your first task (takes 5 minutes)

Before tomorrow's lesson, write down 3 things you know well enough to teach in 3–5 emails. They don't have to be earth-shattering. The best email courses are narrow, specific, and immediately useful.

Think: "How to do X" or "The beginner's guide to Y" — not "Everything about Z."

See you tomorrow with Day 1: choosing your topic and mapping your curriculum.
