The most common reason people never launch their email course: they can't decide what it should be about.

So today, we fix that.

## The one-sentence test

A great email course topic passes this test:

> "This course helps **[specific person]** do **[specific thing]** in **[timeframe or format]**."

"This course helps freelance designers write better proposals in 5 emails."
"This course helps new dog owners survive the first 30 days in one week of emails."
"This course helps founders write a cold email they'd actually reply to — in 3 lessons."

Notice what these have in common: **a narrow audience, a concrete outcome, a contained scope.** If your topic works at the genre level ("everything about marketing"), zoom in until it works at the example level.

## The curriculum skeleton

Email courses work best when each lesson has a clear job:

1. **Welcome** — Why this topic matters, what's coming, and the first small action
2. **Day 1** — The foundational concept. What do they need to understand before anything else works?
3. **Day 2** — The first skill or technique. Something they can apply today.
4. **Day 3** — The advanced move or the launch step. Send them off confident.

You can go up to 7 lessons, but 4–5 is the sweet spot. More than that and drop-off accelerates fast.

## Today's exercise

Open a doc and write:
1. Your one-sentence course description (use the template above)
2. Your 4–5 lesson titles — just the subject lines, nothing else yet

That's your curriculum. You just did the hardest part.
