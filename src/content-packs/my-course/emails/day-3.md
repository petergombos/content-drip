You've done the hard part. You have a topic, a curriculum, and at least a draft of your emails. Today we ship it.

## Your landing page: the one-sentence promise

Your landing page doesn't need to be fancy. It needs to answer one question: _What will I be able to do after taking this course?_

Your headline should be the answer to that question. Not "Welcome to my email course." Not the name of the course. The outcome.

- "Write a cold email you'd actually reply to — in 3 lessons"
- "Survive your first month with a rescue dog. One email a day for 5 days."
- "Go from zero to your first freelance client — free, via email"

ContentDrip's built-in subscribe form handles signup, email confirmation, and delivery scheduling. You just need to write the headline.

## Where to find your first subscribers

**Existing audience first.** Post about it once — Twitter/X, LinkedIn, a newsletter, a Slack community you're part of. Don't over-explain. Share the landing page with your one-sentence promise. That's it.

**Niche communities second.** Find 2–3 online communities (subreddits, Discord servers, Facebook groups) where your specific audience hangs out. Add genuine value first, then mention the course once when it's relevant.

**Referrals third.** Add a line to your final email: "If this helped you, forward it to someone who'd find it useful." One sentence. No pressure. It works.

## The honest truth about growth

Your first version will not be perfect. That's fine. The best email courses get better through iteration — better subject lines, tightened lessons, more useful actions. The only way to improve is to launch and learn.

Start with 10 subscribers. Then 50. Then 100. Each iteration makes the course better for the next person who finds it.

## You're done

You built something real. A course that delivers itself, on a schedule your subscribers choose, to their inbox — forever.

Here's your recap:

- **Day 1** — Topic validated, curriculum mapped
- **Day 2** — Emails written with hooks, lessons, and actions
- **Day 3** — Landing page live, first subscribers incoming
