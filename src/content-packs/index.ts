/**
 * ✏️ Import every content pack you want to register here.

 * Each import triggers a side-effecting `registerPack()` call inside the pack file,

 *
 * To add a new course:
 *   1. Create src/content-packs/your-course/pack.ts
 *   2. Add: import "@/content-packs/your-course/pack";

 * To remove a course, delete its import line below.
