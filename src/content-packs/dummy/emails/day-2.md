Good morning! Yesterday you practiced single-tasking. Today, we're zooming out to design the container that holds your focused work: **your morning routine.**

## Why Mornings Matter

Your willpower is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. By the time you've navigated a full inbox and three meetings, there's often little left for meaningful work.

The morning is your window of highest potential. How you use it sets the trajectory for everything that follows.

## The Intentional Morning Framework

You don't need to wake up at 5 AM. You need to wake up *with intention*. Here's a simple structure:

**First 15 minutes: No screens.** Resist the urge to check your phone. Instead, take a few deep breaths, stretch, or simply sit with your morning coffee.

**Next 30 minutes: Your priority task.** Remember yesterday's single-tasking method? Apply it here, while your mind is freshest.

**Final 15 minutes: Plan your day.** Review your calendar, identify your top three priorities, and consciously let go of everything else.

## Today's Exercise

Tonight, prepare for tomorrow morning:

- Place your phone across the room (not on your nightstand)
- Write down your priority task for the morning
- Set out everything you need — journal, water, coffee

Tomorrow, try the Intentional Morning Framework. Even if you only manage the first 15 minutes without screens, that's a win.
