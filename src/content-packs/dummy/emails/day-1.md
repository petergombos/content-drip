Good morning! Let's start with perhaps the most counterintuitive truth about productivity: **doing less leads to achieving more.**

## The Myth of Multitasking

We've been sold a lie. The ability to juggle five tasks at once isn't a superpower — it's a trap. Research from Stanford University shows that heavy multitaskers are actually *worse* at filtering irrelevant information and slower at switching between tasks.

When you scatter your attention across multiple tasks, you don't get five things done. You get fragments of five things done, each poorly.

## The Single-Task Method

Here's a simple framework to try today:

1. **Choose one task** — the most important thing you need to accomplish
2. **Set a timer** for 25 minutes
3. **Close everything else** — email, chat, social media
4. **Work on that one thing** until the timer rings
5. **Take a 5-minute break**, then repeat

This isn't just about efficiency. When you give something your full attention, you enter a state of flow where work stops feeling like work.

## Today's Exercise

Pick your most important task for today. Before you start, write it on a piece of paper and place it in front of your keyboard. Every time you feel the urge to switch tasks, glance at that paper.

Notice how often the urge arises. Don't judge it — just notice.

Tomorrow, we'll design the perfect morning routine to set you up for focused work.
