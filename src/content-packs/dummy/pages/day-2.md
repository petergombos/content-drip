*How the first hour shapes your entire day.*

## Why Mornings Matter

Your willpower is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. By the time you've navigated a full inbox and three meetings, there's often little left for meaningful work.

The morning is your window of highest potential. How you use it sets the trajectory for everything that follows. This isn't about becoming a "morning person" — it's about being intentional with whatever morning you have.

## The Intentional Morning Framework

You don't need to wake up at 5 AM. You need to wake up *with intention*. Here's a simple structure:

**First 15 minutes: No screens.** Resist the urge to check your phone. Instead, take a few deep breaths, stretch, or simply sit with your morning coffee. This buffer between sleep and stimulation gives your brain time to fully wake up and orient itself.

**Next 30 minutes: Your priority task.** Remember yesterday's single-tasking method? Apply it here, while your mind is freshest. This is when you have the most cognitive resources available — use them on what matters most.

**Final 15 minutes: Plan your day.** Review your calendar, identify your top three priorities, and consciously let go of everything else. This act of planning reduces the anxiety of uncertainty and frees up mental bandwidth.

## The Research

A study published in the journal *Emotion* found that how people feel in the morning has a significant effect on how they feel for the rest of the day. Starting with intention — rather than reactivity — creates a positive cascade that influences your mood, energy, and decision-making.

## Today's Exercise

Tonight, prepare for tomorrow morning:

- Place your phone across the room (not on your nightstand)
- Write down your priority task for the morning
- Set out everything you need — journal, water, coffee

Tomorrow, try the Intentional Morning Framework. Even if you only manage the first 15 minutes without screens, that's a win. Progress over perfection.
