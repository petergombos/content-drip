*Reclaiming your attention from technology.*

## The Attention Economy

The average person checks their phone 96 times per day — roughly once every 10 minutes during waking hours. Each check costs more than the seconds it takes — it costs *context*. After each interruption, research shows it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully return to deep focus.

That's not a personal failing. The apps on your phone were engineered by some of the smartest people alive to capture and hold your attention. Every notification, every red badge, every infinite scroll was designed to trigger a dopamine response that keeps you coming back.

Recognizing this isn't pessimism — it's the first step toward reclaiming your focus.

> "The cost of a thing is the amount of life you're willing to exchange for it." — Henry David Thoreau

## Three Practical Steps

### 1. Audit Your Notifications

Go through your phone settings right now. For each app, ask: "Does this notification require my immediate attention?" If not, turn it off.

Most people discover that 80% of their notifications are noise — promotional emails, social media likes, app updates. Turning these off creates an immediate sense of calm.

### 2. Create Friction

Move social media apps to a folder on your second home screen. Log out after each use. Delete apps you only use out of habit, not intention.

These aren't dramatic gestures. They're small barriers that interrupt the automatic pattern of reaching for your phone. Research shows that even a few seconds of friction is enough to break a habit loop.

### 3. Designate Check-In Times

Instead of reacting to every buzz, check messages at set times — perhaps 9 AM, noon, and 4 PM. Your response time changes from "instant" to "within a few hours," and almost nobody notices the difference.

What does change is your experience of the day. Instead of a constant stream of micro-interruptions, you have long stretches of unbroken focus.

## Today's Exercise

Spend 10 minutes on a notification audit. Go to your phone settings and review every app that can send you notifications. Be ruthless — you can always turn them back on later.

Then, for the rest of today, try checking your phone only at three designated times. Notice how it feels. Notice what you don't miss.
