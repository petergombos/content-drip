## The Problem with Big Goals

We often stall not because we lack ambition, but because our goals feel overwhelming. "Write a book." "Get fit." "Learn a new language." These are noble pursuits, but their scale can paralyze us before we even begin.

The Two-Minute Rule, popularized by David Allen in *Getting Things Done*, offers an elegant solution:

> If something takes less than two minutes, do it now.

But there's a deeper version of this rule that most people miss entirely.

## The Deeper Two-Minute Rule

**Any habit can be started in under two minutes.**

- Want to read more? Open your book and read one page.
- Want to exercise? Put on your running shoes.
- Want to meditate? Sit and take three deep breaths.
- Want to write? Open a blank document and type one sentence.

The goal isn't to *finish* in two minutes. It's to *start*. Once you've started, continuing is almost effortless. Newton's First Law applies to productivity just as it does to physics: an object in motion stays in motion.

## Why This Works

The hardest part of any task is beginning. Our brains are wired to conserve energy and avoid uncertainty. A large task feels uncertain — will it be hard? Will I fail? — so we avoid it.

But a two-minute task feels safe. Your brain doesn't resist it because the cost is so small. And once you're doing the thing, the resistance dissolves. You've already started. You're already in motion.

## Today's Exercise

Identify one task you've been procrastinating on. Now, define the two-minute version:

- **Full task:** Organize my entire desk
- **Two-minute version:** Clear one small corner
- **Full task:** Start a fitness routine
- **Two-minute version:** Do five pushups
- **Full task:** Learn a new skill
- **Two-minute version:** Watch one 2-minute tutorial

Do the two-minute version right now, before reading another word.

Notice what happens next. Most people find that once they start, they keep going far beyond two minutes.
