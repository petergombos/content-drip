preview: Reclaiming your attention from technology

Good morning! We've covered single-tasking, morning routines, and building momentum. Today we tackle the biggest obstacle to all three: **the constant pull of digital distraction.**

## The Attention Economy

The average person checks their phone 96 times per day. Each check costs more than the seconds it takes — it costs *context*. After each interruption, research shows it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully return to a task.

That's not a personal failing. The apps on your phone were engineered by some of the smartest people alive to capture and hold your attention. Recognizing this isn't pessimism — it's the first step toward reclaiming your focus.

## Three Practical Steps

**1. Audit your notifications.** Go through your phone settings right now. For each app, ask: "Does this notification require my immediate attention?" If not, turn it off. Most people disable 80% of their notifications and never miss anything important.

**2. Create friction.** Move social media apps to a folder on your second home screen. Log out after each use. These small barriers reduce mindless usage dramatically.

**3. Designate check-in times.** Instead of reacting to every buzz, check messages at set times — perhaps 9 AM, noon, and 4 PM. Your response time changes from "instant" to "within a few hours," and nobody notices.

## Today's Exercise

Spend 10 minutes on a notification audit. Go to your phone settings and review every app that can send you notifications. Be ruthless — you can always turn them back on.

Then, for the rest of today, try checking your phone only at three designated times.

Tomorrow we wrap everything together into a sustainable system you can use for life.
