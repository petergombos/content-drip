Good morning! By now you've practiced single-tasking and intentional mornings. Today's lesson is about the secret weapon that ties everything together: **momentum.**

## The Problem with Big Goals

We often stall not because we lack ambition, but because our goals feel overwhelming. "Write a book." "Get fit." "Learn a new language." These are noble pursuits, but their scale can paralyze us.

The Two-Minute Rule, popularized by David Allen, offers an elegant solution:

> If something takes less than two minutes, do it now.

But there's a deeper version of this rule that most people miss.

## The Deeper Two-Minute Rule

**Any habit can be started in under two minutes.**

- Want to read more? Open your book and read one page.
- Want to exercise? Put on your running shoes.
- Want to meditate? Sit and take three deep breaths.

The goal isn't to *finish* in two minutes. It's to *start*. Once you've started, continuing is almost effortless. Newton's First Law applies to productivity: an object in motion stays in motion.

## Today's Exercise

Identify one task you've been procrastinating on. Now, define the two-minute version:

- **Full task:** Organize my entire desk
- **Two-minute version:** Clear one small corner

Do the two-minute version right now, before reading another word.

Notice what happens next. Most people find that once they start, they keep going.
