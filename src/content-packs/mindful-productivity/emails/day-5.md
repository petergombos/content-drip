Good morning — and congratulations! You've made it to the final lesson. Let's talk about how to make everything you've learned **stick.**

## The Habit Loop

Every habit follows the same cycle: **Cue → Routine → Reward.** Understanding this loop is the key to making new behaviors automatic.

- **Cue:** The trigger that starts the behavior (your alarm goes off)
- **Routine:** The behavior itself (you sit down for focused work)
- **Reward:** The benefit you feel (a sense of accomplishment)

The secret to sustainable habits isn't discipline — it's designing the loop so well that the behavior becomes automatic.

## Your Mindful Productivity Stack

Over the past five days, you've learned four powerful techniques. Here's how they work together as a daily practice:

**Morning:** Use the Intentional Morning Framework (Day 2). Start with no screens, then tackle your priority task using single-tasking (Day 1).

**Throughout the day:** Apply the Two-Minute Rule (Day 3) to maintain momentum. Check devices only at designated times (Day 4).

**Evening:** Spend 5 minutes preparing for tomorrow — set your priority task, lay out what you need, and disconnect from screens.

## The 1% Rule

You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be 1% better each day. Some mornings you'll wake up and reach for your phone. Some afternoons you'll fall into a multitasking spiral. That's human.

What matters isn't perfection — it's the gentle return. Notice when you've drifted, and bring yourself back without judgment. Over weeks and months, these small corrections compound into a completely different relationship with your work.

## Your Final Exercise

Take 10 minutes today to write down your personal productivity system:

1. **Your morning routine** (keep it simple — 3 steps maximum)
2. **Your single-tasking commitment** (what tools and techniques will you use?)
3. **Your digital boundaries** (which notifications are off? When do you check messages?)
4. **Your evening preparation** (how will you set up tomorrow for success?)

Pin this somewhere visible. Revisit and adjust it weekly.

Thank you for spending five mornings with us. The lessons are short, but the practice is long. Be patient with yourself, and remember: the goal isn't to be productive every minute. It's to be *intentional* about how you spend your attention.

You've got this.
